Program Correctness
-------------------
I used JUnit to verify the correctness of my project. I have ~25 unit tests
that demonstrate the proper working of my implementations of graph functions:
inserting arcs/vertices, annotating graph elements, reversing arcs, removing 
arcs/vertices, etc.

I verified the results of my graph by checking them against the graphs in the
project description page. All metrics from my graphs matched those of the 
sample graphs.

Graph Results

Here is a sample set of results copied from output.txt.

I wrote Driver to compute the extra SCC information on graphs with < 500 vertices.
When auxiliary vertex data is not given to the application, the SCC members are 
identified by their vertex identifiers as seen above. Driver.java has the method
computeAdditionalSCCData, which orders the SCCs from largest to smallest. 

For graphs with > 500 vertices, the additional SCC information is not displayed:

    ===============================================================

Not all .vna files came with the number of SCCs they contain. However, I put my 
code through enough rigorous testing to be confident that this output is correct.
Here we have 20086 SCCs in a graph with 27770 vertices and 352807 edges.
