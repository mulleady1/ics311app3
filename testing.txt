Program Correctness
-------------------
I used JUnit to verify the correctness of my project. I have ~25 unit tests
that demonstrate the proper working of my implementations of graph functions:
inserting arcs/vertices, annotating graph elements, reversing arcs, removing 
arcs/vertices, etc.

I verified the results of my graph by checking them against the graphs in the
project description page. 

Graph Results
-------------
All results can be found in output.txt.  I didn't get output for as many
graphs as I wanted, as my program was running for nearly the entire day
before the night of submission!

From Project 2, the additional SCC data for smaller graphs showed up in my 
output for graphs with less than 500 vertices.

There are some discrepencies between my output and the sample outputs in the 
Project 3 description page.  I spent a very large amount of time ensuring my 
algorithms were correct implementations of the equations in the texts of CLRS 
and Newman.  I guess you'll be the judge of whether my discrepencies are 
substantiated!
