Compilation
-----------
The easiest way to compile my project is to use the 'run' script, which is located in 
this directory. Use it like this:
    
    ./run <vna_file> [<vna_file> ...]

You can provide one or more vna file arguments. All vna files from Dr. Suthers' project 
description page are already in this directory, with the exception of the last file, 
web-google.vna.

This script compiles only the java files in the src/ directory. If you want to run my
test cases (in the test/ directory) you'll need to compile and run them manually.
